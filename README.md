# DAA-in-C
This repository is dedicated to practicing and improving my skills in Design Patterns, Data Structures, and Algorithms. The main goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in these key areas and solve a wide range of problems across various difficulty levels. Each algorithm or design pattern will be implemented from scratch.
